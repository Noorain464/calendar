# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Summary

The Event Management App is a web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete events for selected dates. Each event includes details such as the name, start time, end time, description, and category (e.g., work, personal, other). Users can also filter events by name and search for specific keywords. The app features a clean and user-friendly interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for fast development and deployment.

### Features
- **Event Creation**: Create events with a name, start time, end time, description, and category.
- **Event Management**: Edit and delete events from the list.
